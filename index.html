             <h3>Colorful Streets</h3>
             <p>We spent our first few nights in Old San Juan, where we were met with bright colorful buildings and narrow cobblestone streets. It was a lot of fun to get lost in the maze of streets on our way to discover new shops, restuarants, and bars.</p>

             <h3>Exploring the Fort</h3>
             <p>We had a wonderful few afternoons exploring Castillo San Felipe del Morro and found it to be much larger than it first appeared.  This map became very useful as we navigated the various parts of the fort and got a chance to explore every corner. We were continually struck by the contrast between the lush green space and degrading fort walls.</p>

             <h3>Castillo San Felipe del Morro</h3>
             <p>Old San Juan is home to Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a fort that was built to guard San Juan Bay and defend against seaborn enemies.  It's a World Heritage Site and sits right next to the bustling, colorful buildings of the city.  It offers a stark contrast when looked at directly next to those streets between old world history and the progress that has been made since.</p>

             <h3>The Palace of Laws</h3>
             <p>The capitol building in Old San Juan is imposing and elegant.  Sometimes referred to as The House of Laws, the building overlooks the coastline and standing atop the nearby fort allows for a scenic view of the Capitol and the coast.  There's also a cemetary alongside it, featuring some unique and eye-catching headstones and gravesites.</p>

             <h3>The Fountain</h3>
             <p>I never did learn the name of this lovely fountain that we stumbled upon, but we found it while on an exploratory walk on our first afternoon in Old San Juan. We had been walking along the path around the coast and had just meandered inland when we came across a lovely garden and at one end sat this beauty.  A photoshoot ensued and some of my favorite photos of us came about here.</p>
